## Highlight
This project is designed to provide an opportunity to gain a practical insight into the work done at KPMG and apply Data analytics skills for a KPMG client project. The project consists of 3 tasks.


## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
Given the client information on demographics and transaction, we are tasked to perform preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of client data. I used excel to identify quality issues and to rectify them.


## Task 2: Approach to Target customers
This task outlines the approach to analyze the client to identify high value customers based demographics and their attributes. Prepared a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting.


## Task 3: Insight Reporting
Developed a dashboard using Tableau that displays the data summary and results of the analysis. Some of the focussed business context when presenting findings were:

- What are the trends in the underlying data?
- Which customer segment has the highest customer value?
- What do you propose should be Sprocket Central Pty Ltd ’s marketing and growth strategy?
- What additional external datasets may be useful to obtain greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products?
